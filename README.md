# Storefront AMP
**Storefront AMP** is an extension of the WordPress plugin [AMP].

It tweaks your AMP posts matching the style of Storefront, using the same colors and options from the Customiser.

## Install Storefront AMP
1. Install [AMP] on your WordPress website.
2. Clone or download this repository in your `wp-content/plugins/` folder.
3. Go to **Plugins > Installed Plugins** and activate **Storefront AMP**.

## Limitations
This plugin has been written mainly for [my blog]. It matches the style of Storefront and uses the options from the customiser for the text, links, header and footer color, but not more.

It does not integrate with other [Storefront extensions], but works well anyway if they are active on your site.
