# Storefront AMP
**Storefront AMP** is an extension of the WordPress plugin [AMP](https://wordpress.org/plugins/amp/ "AMP").

It tweaks your AMP posts matching the style of Storefront, using the same colors and options from the Customiser.

## Install Storefront AMP
1. Install [AMP](https://wordpress.org/plugins/amp/ "AMP") on your WordPress website.
2. Clone or download this repository in your `wp-content/plugins/` folder.
3. Go to **Plugins \> Installed Plugins** and activate **Storefront AMP**.

## Limitations
This plugin has been written mainly for [my blog](https://nicolamustone.com/ "Nicola Mustone"). It matches the style of Storefront and uses the options from the customiser for the text, links, header and footer color, but not more.

It does not integrate with other [Storefront extensions](https://woocommerce.com/product-category/storefront-extensions/ "Storefront Extensions"), but works well anyway if they are active on your site.
